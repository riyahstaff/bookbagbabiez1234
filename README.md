# AI Cartoon Studio

An open-source, budget-conscious production pipeline for generating character-consistent
animated episodes — from treatment to finished MP4 — without betting the whole app on
any single AI model vendor.

## Status: Phase 7 (QC and Approvals) complete

Phases 0-6 (research/architecture, app shell, Character Bible, story pipeline,
storyboard system, voice system, video system) are done. Approve/reject/activate and
per-shot versioning already existed from Phase 4 onward, so Phase 7's real delta is
automated QC and a unified preview: a `qc/` package (the location docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
reserved for it from Phase 0) runs cheap, dependency-free heuristics right after every
generation completes - flagging near-blank/blown-out images, near-silent audio, and
(for Mock's GIF output) blank video frames - and writes an advisory `quality_score`/
`qc_notes` onto the `Generation` row. It never blocks approve/reject/activate; it just
surfaces likely-bad output so a reviewer doesn't have to open every version to spot
one. A new Shot Preview section shows a shot's active image/video, dialogue, and
narration together with a QC summary - a real "how does this shot look and sound right
now" view that didn't exist before (still not the synced final export - that's Phase
8's job), and the Scene view flags any shot with a low-scoring active generation. There
is still no lip-sync or episode assembly - that starts in Phase 8 (episode assembler).

## Running it

**With Docker (recommended):**

```
docker compose up --build
```

Frontend at http://localhost:3000, API at http://localhost:8000. Both bind to
localhost only, per the security default in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Manually, for development:**

```
# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env.example` to
`frontend/.env.local` if you need to override any defaults - both work unmodified for
local development.

Run the backend test suite with `.venv/bin/pytest` from `backend/`.

## Design philosophy

1. **Provider-agnostic.** Every AI capability (video, voice, image, upscaling, lip-sync,
   LLM, compute) sits behind an abstract interface with capability detection. No single
   model vendor is load-bearing — this space moves fast enough that betting on one
   model's continued existence is a real risk (see `docs/RESEARCH.md` for a concrete
   example: Alibaba's newest Wan versions are closed API-only).
2. **Local-first, cloud-optional.** The MVP pilot must run end-to-end on a single
   consumer GPU (or a few dollars of rented GPU time). Heavier workloads (batch
   rendering, higher-end models) can burst to rented cloud GPUs, never require them.
3. **Storyboard before video.** Cheap image generation gates expensive video
   generation. This is the single highest-leverage cost control in the whole system
   and is never optional, even in "quality mode."
4. **Series → Episode → Scene → Shot → Version is the fundamental hierarchy.** Nothing
   in the UI, database, or job system should be designed in a way that breaks this.
5. **Human approval before expensive rendering.** Nothing generates video without an
   approved storyboard unless a human explicitly overrides that.
6. **Never lose work.** Every generation is versioned and preserved (including
   rejected ones, until explicit cleanup). Jobs are resumable after a crash.

## License

Repository/application license: **TBD** — to be decided by the project owner before
any public release. This is independent of the licenses on the third-party models the
app talks to (see `docs/LICENSING.md`), which apply regardless of how this repo itself
is licensed.
